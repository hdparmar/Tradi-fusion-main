# Tradifusion
Tradifusion Refined: Evaluating and tuning the Diffusion Model for Irish Traditional Music.

# Focus of the project
The project will investigate the following research questions:
The main question 
- Can the Diffusion model produce good results for generating Irish Traditional music?
    - Yeaapp!!
- How close can we get with Diffusion Model(s)?
    - Pretty close!
- What challenges are involved in fine-tuning the model for Irish Traditional music?
    - Dataset creation, time taken to train for good results and resources.
- Can the fine-tuned model generate Irish Traditional music that is comparable in quality to
human-composed Irish Traditional music? If not, what is the reason?
    - It can produce music similar to Irish Traditional Music, comparable yes but not in the same quality as human-composed music mainly because of downstream methods to conver spectrogram back to audio.

The project is of interest to the field of Music Technology, Culture and Generative AI. It can be of interest to researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts in these fields who are interested in exploring the possibilities of AI-generated music and its potential applications and limitations.

## Background 


## Dependencies üõ†Ô∏è
[Under Construction]

## Training üèãüèΩ
Train on 512 x 512 Spectrograms of Irish Traditional Tunes. 

The dataset contains 512x512 images!
Main Dataset Card (hugging-face) [hdparmar/irish-traditional-tunes](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hdparmar/irish-traditional-tunes).


The fine-tuning training was done on multiple GPUs (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 for Inference and RTX 6000 Ads for Training) with the use of [NVIDIA NGC Tensorflow container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/tensorflow). 

The advantage of using is to avoid erros with cudnn library and errors concering not finding libdevice library under `/usr/local/cuda`. It also helps with the matching the compatible Tensorflow verison with CUDA and cuDNN. 

### Running on Jupyter Lab üìì
The file `finetune_itt.ipynb` can be used to play with the model, visualise the results and tweak the parameters using the config file `spectrogram.yaml` and see the outcome. Once you are satisfied with that, you can go forward and make a training script.
